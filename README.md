## Prerequisites

Before using this repository, ensure that you have the following:

- **Kubernetes Cluster**: A working Kubernetes cluster.
- **Flux CLI**: Install the Flux CLI.
- **Git**: You should have Git installed to clone and manage the repository.
- **Kubectl**: To interact with the Kubernetes cluster.

## Flux Setup

This repository uses Flux to manage the deployment of Kubernetes resources. Flux continuously watches this repository for changes and automatically applies them to the cluster. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how Flux is set up in this repository:

- GitRepository: A custom Flux resource that tells Flux where the Git repository is located, which branch to track, and the synchronization interval.
- Kustomization: A Flux resource used to define what paths and resources to apply to the cluster.

These resources are defined in the following files:

- flux-system/flux-gitrepository.yaml - Defines the Git repository for Flux to track.
- flux-system/flux-kustomization.yaml - Defines the Kustomization to apply the manifests located in this repository.
